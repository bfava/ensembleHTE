Title: Ensemble Methods for Learning Features of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
Version: 0.1.0

    )
Description: Implements ensemble methods for heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) 
    estimation and general prediction tasks. Combines predictions from multiple machine 
    learning algorithms using cross-validated Best Linear Predictor weights with 
    repeated K-fold cross-fitting. Provides analysis tools including Group Average 
    Treatment Effects (GATES), Best Linear Predictor (BLP), Classification Analysis 
    (CLAN), and Group Averages (GAvs). 
    Based on the methodology described in Fava (2025).
