\title{Compute cross-regression covariance}
\usage{
.calc_cov_cross_reg(X1, X2, resid1, resid2, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{Model matrix from regression 1}

\item{X2}{Model matrix from regression 2}

\item{resid1}{Residuals from regression 1}

\item{resid2}{Residuals from regression 2}

\item{weights}{Optional WLS weights (same for both regressions). When provided,
uses the WLS sandwich formula with weighted bread and meat. NULL for OLS.}
}
\value{
Covariance matrix between coefficients of regression 1 (rows) and regression 2 (cols)
}
\description{
Computes the covariance between coefficient estimates from two different
regressions using the same data. This is needed to correctly compute the
standard error of the difference between estimates from two regressions.
