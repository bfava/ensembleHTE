\title{Compute GATES (Group Average Treatment Effects)}
\usage{
gates(
  ensemble_fit,
  n_groups = 3,
  outcome = NULL,
  treatment = NULL,
  prop_score = NULL,
  controls = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  subset = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemble_fit}{An object of class \code{ensemble_hte_fit} from \code{ensemble_hte()}
or \code{ensemble_pred_fit} from \code{ensemble_pred()}.}

\item{n_groups}{Number of groups to divide the sample into (default: 3)}

\item{outcome}{Either:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): uses the same outcome as in the ensemble function
  \item Character string: column name in the \code{data} used in the ensemble function
  \item Numeric vector: custom outcome variable (must have same length as data)
}
This allows computing GATES for a different outcome than the one used for prediction.}

\item{treatment}{For \code{ensemble_pred_fit} only. The treatment variable:
\itemize{
  \item Character string: column name in the \code{data} used in \code{ensemble_pred()}
  \item Numeric vector: binary treatment variable (must have same length as data)
}
Ignored for \code{ensemble_hte_fit} (uses the treatment from the fit).}

\item{prop_score}{For \code{ensemble_pred_fit} only. Propensity score:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): estimated as mean of treatment variable
  \item Numeric value: constant propensity score for all observations
  \item Numeric vector: observation-specific propensity scores
}
For \code{ensemble_hte_fit}, uses the propensity score from the fit.}

\item{controls}{Character vector of control variable names to include in regression.
These must be column names present in the \code{data} argument used when calling
the ensemble function.}

\item{strata}{Optional. Stratification variable for restricted ranking:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): unrestricted ranking across full sample within folds
  \item Character string: column name in the \code{data} for stratified ranking
  \item Numeric/factor vector: strata indicator (must have same length as data)
}
When specified, predicted values are ranked within each stratum (and fold),
rather than across the full sample.}

\item{subset}{Which observations to use for the GATES analysis. Options:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): uses all observations (or training obs for \code{ensemble_pred_fit}
    when using the default outcome with subset training)
  \item \code{"train"}: uses only training observations (for \code{ensemble_pred_fit} only)
  \item \code{"all"}: explicitly uses all observations
  \item Logical vector: TRUE/FALSE for each observation (must have same length as data)
  \item Integer vector: indices of observations to include (1-indexed)
}
This allows evaluating GATES on a subset of observations. Note that GATES 
requires observations from both treatment and control groups in the subset.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gates_results} containing:
\itemize{
  \item estimates: data.table with GATES estimates averaged across repetitions
  \item top_bottom: data.table with the top-bottom difference test
  \item all: data.table with the average treatment effect (weighted avg of all groups)
  \item top_all: data.table with the top minus average test
  \item n_groups: number of groups used
  \item outcome: the outcome variable used for GATES
  \item targeted_outcome: the outcome used for prediction
  \item fit_type: "hte" or "pred" depending on input
  \item strata: the stratification variable used (if any)
  \item controls: control variables used (if any)
  \item M: number of repetitions
  \item call: the function call
}

\description{
Computes Group Average Treatment Effects (GATES), an estimand introduced by
Chernozhukov et al. (2025) to measure average treatment effects for groups
defined by predicted value quantiles.

This function works with both \code{ensemble_hte_fit} (groups by predicted ITE)
and \code{ensemble_pred_fit} (groups by predicted Y). For prediction fits, a
treatment variable must be specified.

This function implements the multiple-split estimation strategy developed by
Fava (2025), which combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms
into an ensemble and averages GATES estimates across M repetitions of K-fold
cross-fitting to improve statistical power.

The method uses weighted least squares regression of Y on group indicators
interacted with (D - propensity_score), with weights equal to
1 / (propensity_score * (1 - propensity_score)). Groups are formed by
ranking predicted values within each fold.
Robust (HC1) standard errors are computed.
