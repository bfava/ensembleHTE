\title{Compare GAVS: Unrestricted vs Restricted Ranking}
\usage{
gavs_compare(ensemble_fit, strata, n_groups = 3, outcome = NULL, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemble_fit}{An object of class \code{ensemble_hte_fit} from 
\code{ensemble_hte()} or \code{ensemble_pred_fit} from \code{ensemble_pred()}.}

\item{strata}{The stratification variable defining groups for restricted ranking:
\itemize{
  \item Character string: column name in the \code{data} used in the ensemble function
  \item Numeric/factor vector: strata indicator (must have same length as data)
}}

\item{n_groups}{Number of groups to divide the sample into (default: 3)}

\item{outcome}{Either:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): uses the same outcome as in the ensemble function
  \item Character string: column name in the \code{data} used in the ensemble function
  \item Numeric vector: custom outcome variable (must have appropriate length)
}}

\item{subset}{Which observations to use for the GAVS comparison. Options:
\itemize{
  \item NULL (default): uses all observations (or training obs for \code{ensemble_pred_fit}
    when using the default outcome with subset training)
  \item \code{"train"}: uses only training observations (for \code{ensemble_pred_fit} only)
  \item \code{"all"}: explicitly uses all observations
  \item Logical vector: TRUE/FALSE for each observation (must have same length as data)
  \item Integer vector: indices of observations to include (1-indexed)
}
This allows evaluating GAVS comparison on a subset of observations.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gavs_compare_results} containing:
\itemize{
  \item unrestricted: \code{gavs_results} object for unrestricted strategy
  \item restricted: \code{gavs_results} object for restricted strategy
  \item difference: data.table with the difference (unrestricted - restricted)
    for each group, with properly computed standard errors
  \item top_bottom_diff: data.table with difference in top-bottom estimates
  \item strata_var: name of the stratification variable
  \item strata_levels: unique levels of the stratification variable
  \item n_groups: number of groups used
  \item outcome: the outcome variable used
  \item targeted_outcome: the outcome used for prediction
  \item fit_type: "hte" or "pred" depending on input
  \item n_used: number of observations used
  \item M: number of repetitions
  \item call: the function call
}
}
\description{
Compares Group Averages (GAVS) between an unrestricted strategy (ranking
predictions across the full sample) and a restricted strategy (ranking
predictions within strata of a stratification variable).

This function implements the analysis from Fava (2025) to test whether
ranking by predicted values within subgroups (e.g., income quintiles,
education levels) yields different targeting results than global ranking.

The key statistical challenge is computing correct standard errors for the
difference between the two strategies, since they use the same data. This
is handled by computing the cross-covariance between regression estimates.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit ensemble
fit <- ensemble_hte(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = mydata, treatment = "D")

# Compare unrestricted vs restricted by income quintile
comparison <- gavs_compare(fit, strata = "income_quintile", n_groups = 5)
print(comparison)

# The difference shows how much GAVS estimates change when restricting
# ranking to within each income quintile
