\title{Summary Method for ensemble_pred_fit Objects}
\usage{
\method{summary}{ensemble_pred_fit}(object, n_groups = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{ensemble_pred_fit} from \code{\link{ensemble_pred}}.}

\item{n_groups}{Number of groups for GAVS analysis (default: 5).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a \code{summary.ensemble_pred_fit} object containing:
\itemize{
  \item call: The original function call
  \item outcome: Name of the outcome variable
  \item n: Total number of observations
  \item n_train: Number of training observations
  \item M: Number of repetitions
  \item prediction_summary: Summary statistics for predictions
  \item metrics: Prediction accuracy metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE, correlation)
  \item blp: BLP calibration test results
  \item gavs: GAVS group average results
}
}
\description{
Provides a comprehensive summary of an ensemble prediction fit, including
descriptive statistics, prediction accuracy metrics, BLP calibration test,
and GAVS group averages.
When \code{train_idx} was used, accuracy metrics are computed only on
training observations (where Y is observed).

\examples{
\dontrun{
fit <- ensemble_pred(Y ~ ., data = mydata)
summary(fit)
summary(fit, n_groups = 3)
}
